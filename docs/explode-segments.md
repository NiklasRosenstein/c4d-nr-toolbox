# Explode Segments

The **Explode Segments** command is basically the Cinema 4D **Polygon Groups
to Objects** command, but many times faster. To use it, select a single Polygon
Object and run the command. The command employs an efficient algorithm that is
easily 20x faster than the native Cinema 4D command and it supports

- UVW
- Vertex Weights
- Vertex Color (R18+)
