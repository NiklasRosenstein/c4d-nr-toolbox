Create MoGraph connectors on an object hierarchy. This project started
May 2013 and is now publicly available with source code. It is almost in
its original state. There is no guarantee that it will be maintained, but
feel free to create a new Issue if you have problems conpiling the plugin
or have an idea for improvements.

#### Usage

Select a **Null-Object** that contains all the objects that you want to connect.
Then open the AutoConnect plugin, change the parameters in the dialog and click
the "Execute" button.
