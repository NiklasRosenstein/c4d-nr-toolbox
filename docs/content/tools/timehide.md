The **TimeHide** feature was previously available as a separate plugin on the
[niklasrosenstein.com] online store and is now integrated into **NR Workflow
Tools**. It provides an enhanced workflow for animators that regularly deal
with large amounts of animated objects, removing the clutter from the Cinema
4D **Timeline** and showing you only what you want to focus on.

> __Original Plugin Description__
>
> Working with the Timeline in Cinema 4D can become uncomfortable very fast.
> Only a few objects and parameters animated can let you loose the overview.
> Cinema 4D’s “Automatic Mode ” and “Link View to Object Manager” commands do
> not help much.
>
> The TimeHide plugin helps you to keep your Timeline in Cinema 4D clean and
> organized. Unnecessary elements are hidden so you only see what’s important.
> he plugin adds a new tab to your document settings. From there, you can
> enable or disable the functionality of the plugin.

The **Only Show Selected Elements** option will hide all elements from the
Timeline that are not selected in their respective other manager (ie. the
Object Manager, Material Manager, XPresso Manager, etc.).

The **Only Show Animated Elements** option will hide all elements that are
currently displayed in the Timeline, but that do not have any keyframes set
(eg. if you deleted all keys of a track, the object would still be visible).

In the below GIF, you can see an example with the parameter enabled and also
with the *Tracks within the Preview Range* mode set in the **Display Tracks**
parameter.
